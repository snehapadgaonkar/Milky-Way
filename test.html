    What is the Milky way?
    </h2>
    <p> We live in one of the arms of a large spiral galaxy called the Milky Way. The Sun and its planets (including Earth) lie in this quiet part of the galaxy, about half way out from the centre.
    The Milky Way is shaped like a huge whirlpool that rotates once every 200 million years. It is made up of at least 100 billion stars, as well as dust and gas. It is so big that light takes 
    100 000 years to cross from one side to the other.The centre of the Galaxy is very hard to see because clouds of gas and dust block our view. Scientists think that it contains a supermassive black hole that swallows anything passing too close.The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. Its name "milky" is derived from its appearance as a dim glowing band arching across the night sky whose individual stars cannot be distinguished by the naked eye.
